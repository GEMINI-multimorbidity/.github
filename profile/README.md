### GEMINI: Genetic Evaluation of Multimorbidity towards INdividualisation of Interventions. 

We are studying links between **72 long-term conditions** (LTCs) that could help improve interventions and treatments, using data from:
 - two large population-representative primary care datasets: **_CPRD_** and **_SIDIAP_**,
 - up to three sources of genetics data: **_UK Biobank_**, **_FinnGen_**, and multiple consortium meta-analyses (where available).

 - 📚 Harmonised [diagnostic codes](https://github.com/GEMINI-multimorbidity/GEMINI-LTC-code-list-Public) for each long-term condition ascertained in GEMINI.
 - 📦 R package {[partialLDSC](https://github.com/GEMINI-multimorbidity/partialLDSC)} to estimate partial genetic correlations from GWAS results.
 - 🧬 GWAS summary statistics for the 72 LTCs are available to [download via Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14284046).
