### GEMINI: Genetic Evaluation of Multimorbidity towards INdividualisation of Interventions. 

We are studying links between **72 long-term conditions** that could help improve interventions and treatments, using data from:
 - two large population-representative primary care datasets: **_CPRD_** and **_SIDIAP_**,
 - up to three sources of genetics data: **_UK Biobank_**, **_FinnGen_**, and multiple consortium meta-analyses (where available).

⭐ Our preprint is available! If you use these resources please cite the below and include the resource release version:

#### Resources available:
 - 📚 Harmonised [diagnostic codes](https://github.com/GEMINI-multimorbidity/GEMINI-LTC-code-list-Public) for each long-term condition ascertained in GEMINI.
 - 📦 R package {[partialLDSC](https://github.com/GEMINI-multimorbidity/partialLDSC)} to estimate partial genetic correlations from GWAS results (preprint coming soon!)
