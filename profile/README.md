### GEMINI: Genetic Evaluation of Multimorbidity towards INdividualisation of Interventions. 

We are studying links between **72 long-term conditions** (LTCs) that could help improve interventions and treatments, using data from:
 - two large population-representative primary care datasets: **_CPRD_** and **_SIDIAP_**,
 - up to three sources of genetics data: **_UK Biobank_**, **_FinnGen_**, and multiple consortium meta-analyses (where available).
